``pypsucurvetrace`` is a software toolbox for curve tracing of electronic devices. ``pypsucurvetrace`` uses programmable power supplies to apply different voltages to the device and to determine the currents flowing through the device as a function of the voltages applied (the «curve data»). ``pypsucurvetrace`` also provides tools to process the data and to plot the «curves» of these data.
