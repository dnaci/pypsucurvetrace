Working with the |curvetrace| program
-------------------------------------

Configuring the PSUs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use the |curvetrace| program, you need to setup the PSU configuration file (see :ref:`curvetrace_PSUconfig`). It is assumed that PSU1 unit is a Riden 6012P operating in it's low-current / high-resolution mode, while PSU2 is a Riden 6006P (see :ref:`supported_PSUs`). These PSUs will be useful for testing a wide range of differen DUT types.

The simplest method to determine the ``COMPORT`` for PSU1 on Linux is to disconnect all serial interfaces except PSU1, and then list the virtual file representing the PSU1 serial port in the ``/dev/serial/by-path/`` directory. Repeat for PSU2.

Create the ``curvetrace_config.txt`` file in your home directory and then enter the following parameters (your ``COMPORT`` settings will be different):::

   [PSU1]
   TYPE    = RIDEN_6A
   COMPORT = /dev/serial/by-path/pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:2.4.3:1.0-port0

   [PSU2]
   TYPE    = RIDEN
   COMPORT = /dev/serial/by-path/pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:2.4.2:1.0-port0

This minimal PSU configuration file contains all information for the |curvetrace| program to establish the communication with PSU1 and PSU2.



Curve tracing of a low-power N-channel FET
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This first example uses the PSU configuration from above to demonstrate the curve tracing of a J112 N-channel jFET.

The J112 needs a positive Drain-Source voltage (|U1|) and a negative Gate-Source voltage (|U2|). Therefore, connect PSU1 with positive polarity and PSU2 with negative polarity to the J112 pins following the schematic in :ref:`curvetrace`:

   * PSU1-red to the Drain pin
   * PSU1-black to the Source pin and to PSU2-red
   * PSU2-red to PSU1-black
   * PSU2-black to a grid-stopper resistor at the Gate pin (approximately 1 k\ |Ohm|)
   
The test parameters for the J112 are defined by creating a ``J112_config.txt`` file containing the following parameters (see also :ref:`curvetrace_DUTconfig`):::

   [PSU1]
   POLARITY = 1
   VSTART = 0
   VEND   = 15
   VSTEP  = 1
   IMAX   = 0.05
   PMAX   = 0.25
   VIDLE  = 7.5
   IIDLE  = 0.02

   [PSU2]
   POLARITY = -1
   VSTART = 0.0
   VEND   = 3.5
   VSTEP  = 0.5
   IMAX   = 1
   PMAX   = 1
   VIDLE     = 5.0
   VIDLE_MIN = 0.0
   VIDLE_MAX = 5.0
   IDLE_GM   = -0.01
   IIDLE     = 1

   [EXTRA]
   IDLESECS    = 0
   PREHEATSECS = 20

Execute the following command to start the curve tracing:

.. code-block:: console

   curvetrace -c J112_config.txt
   
The |curvetrace| program starts communication with the PSUs, configures the test parameters, and asks you for a file name to save the DUT test data. Once everything is ready, the |curvetrace| program runst the pre-heat process by setting |U1| to the PSU1-``VIDLE`` value (7.5 v) and adjust |U2| until |I1| attains the PSU1-``IIDLE`` value of 0.02 A (20 mA). After 20 seconds the pre-heat is stopped (``PREHEATSECS``), and the curve tracing starts. |U2| is set to 0.0 V, and |U1| is stepped from 0-15 V in 1 V steps. This sequence is repeated for |U2| = -0.5 V, -1.0 V, ... , and -3.5 V. At each step, |U1|, |I1|, |U2|, and |I2| are measured and saved to the data file. The ``curvetrace`` program shows a live plot of the curve data during the measurement as shown below.

Curve tracing of a low-power NPN BJT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EXAMPLE WITH BC550, SHOWING HOW TO USE R2 TO CONTROL THE BASE CURRENT

This example demonstrates how to test a bipolar transistor (BJT). In contrast to the previous FET example, the BJT is controlled the the base *current*. Since the base current is typically much smaller than the current measurement resolution of most PSUs, the ``curvetrace`` program uses the |R2| resistor to convert the |U2| voltage to the base current value (see ref:`curvetrace` for details). The conversion relies on the exact |R2| value, which is determined by the max. |U2| output voltage of the PSU2 and the max. |IB| current required for the test. The max. output voltage of PSU2 (Riden 6006P) is 60 V, and the targeted base current should range up to about 50 Î¼A. With |IB| = (|U2| - |VBEon|) / |R2|, a suitable value for the test is |R2| = 100 k\ |Ohm|.

The BC550 needs a positive Collector-Emitter voltage (|U1|) and a positive Base-Emitter voltage (|U2|), so you need to connect the pins as follows:

   * PSU1-red to the Collector pin
   * PSU1-black to the Emitter pin and to PSU2-black
   * PSU2-red to the Base pin via the 100 k\ |Ohm| |R2| resistor
   * PSU2-black to PSU2-black
   
The test parameters for the BC550 are defined in the same way as in the previous example by creating a file ``BC550_config.txt`` with the following parameters:::

   [PSU1]
   POLARITY = 1
   VSTART = 0
   VEND   = 20
   VSTEP  = 1
   IMAX   = 0.1
   PMAX   = 0.5
   VIDLE  = 5
   IIDLE  = 0.02
   
   [PSU2]
   POLARITY = 1
   VSTART = 0.65
   VEND   = 6.65
   VSTEP  = 0.5
   IMAX   = 0.1
   PMAX   = 1
   VIDLE     = 0.8
   VIDLE_MIN = 0.0
   VIDLE_MAX = 20
   IDLE_GM   = 0.01
   IIDLE     = 1
   
   [EXTRA]
   R2CONTROL = 100000
   IDLESECS    = 2
   PREHEATSECS = 60
   NREP        = 1

Run |curvetrace|:

.. code-block:: console

   curvetrace -c BC550_config.txt

The curve tracing works in the same way as in the previous example, with two notable differences:
   * The |U2| steps start at 0.65 V, which is the (assumed) |VBEon| value of the BC550. The conversion from |U2| to the base-current will done later during curve plotting and data processing (see also :ref:`examples_curveplot`, :ref:`examples_curveprocess` and :ref:`examples_curvematch`).
   * There is a 2 second idle time between each reading for thermal re-equilibration of the BC550 before each reading. This reduces the thermal runaway at higher power levels due to self-heating of the transistor. The following plot compares the BC550 curves measured with and without the idle time between readings:

Curve tracing of a power transistor using temperature control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Power transistors typically produce a lot more heat than the low-power devices in the previous examples. To avoid thermal runaway and distortion of the curves at high power levels, the DUT temperature must remain stable during curve tracing. This could be achieved in the same way as in the BC550 example by inserting idle periods where the DUT is operated at fixed power level to attains thermal equilibrium before the next reading. However, at higher power levels, the required idle periods can become excessively long, and self-heating during a single measurement may become significant.

A more efficient method to control the DUT temperature is to clamp it to a large block of metal with a regulated heater element. The thermal inertia of the metal block greatly reduces short-term fluctuations of the DUT temperature. The heater allows controlling the temperature of the metal block and the DUT to a predefined value.

The |curvetrace| program has a built-in PID controller for the heater block. The controller works by sensing the heater block with a DS18B20 temperature sensor, and by adjusting the output of the programmable PSU that powers the heater element. See :ref:`curvetrace_heaterblock` for an example of such a heater block.
