Overview

``pypsucurvetrace`` uses programmable power supplies to apply different voltages to an electronic device and to determine the currents flowing through the device as a function of the voltages applied (the «curve data»). ``pypsucurvetrace`` also provides tools to process the data and to plot the «curves» of these data.

The ``pypsucurvetrace`` package provides the following command-line programs:

* ``curvetrace`` is the main program to acquire curve data. See :ref:`curvetrace` details.
* ``curveplot`` is a helper program to plot curve data. See :ref:`curveplot` manual for details.
* ``curveprocess`` is a helper program to determine characteristic parameters from curve data. See :ref:`curveprocess` manual for details.
