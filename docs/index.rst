``pypsucurvetrace`` documentation
=================================

``pypsucurvetrace`` is a software toolbox for I/V curve tracing of electronic devices. ``pypsucurvetrace`` uses programmable power supplies to determine curves of currents flowing through the device as a function of different voltages applied to the device. 


.. note::

   The ``pypsucurvetrace`` code and this documentation are under development.
