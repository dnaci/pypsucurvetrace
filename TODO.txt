curvetrace PPS To Do

* allow test configuration from external file (instead of interactive user input)

* allow inverted polarity of PSU outputs. PPS output is always positive, but testing at negative voltages+currents is possible by inverting the connections to the DUT. This should be reflected by negative values in the test results.

* catch failures in the serial communication with the PPS units, and retry the communication. Failed communication leads to interrupted test runs, which can be inconvenient.
