# Configuration for first power supply (PSU-1): #
#################################################
[PSU1]

# DUT is connected with normal polarity (not inverted):
POLARITY = 1

# Test voltage V1 start:
VSTART = 0

# Test voltage V1 end:
VEND   = 250

# Test voltage V1 steps:
VSTEP  = 5

# Max. allowed current during the test:
IMAX   = 0.7

# Max. allowed power during the test:
PMAX   = 70

# Idle conditions for pre-heat and idle between readings are configured to fixed values (PSU2 output will be regulated to attain these values, see below):

# - Idle voltage is (will be set as voltage limit at PSU-1 during idling):
VIDLE  = 120

#   (no min. or max. idle voltage is specified, which tells the program to use a fixed V1 idle voltage)

# - Idle current, which is the target value to be attained with PSU-2 regulation
#   (make sure this is lower and not too close to IMAX):
IIDLE  = 0.4

# Configuration for second power supply (PSU-2): #
##################################################
[PSU2]

# DUT is connected with normal polarity (not inverted):
POLARITY = -1

# Test voltage V2 start:
VSTART = 0

# Test voltage V2 end:
VEND   = 100.0

# Test voltage V2 steps:
VSTEP  = 10

# Max. allowed current during the test (usually this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
IMAX   = 1

# Max. allowed power during the test (again, this is usually way more than necessary):
PMAX   = 5

# Idle conditions configured such that PSU-2 regulates the idle conditions configured for PSU-1

# - V2 start value:
VIDLE     = 50

# - V2 minimum value:
VIDLE_MIN = 0

# - V2 maximum value:
VIDLE_MAX = 100

# - The DUT transconductance value (in A/V) to be used for regulation of the I1 idle current by adjusting the V2 voltage:
#   (IDLE_GM = delta-I1 / delta-U2 ratio of the DUT at the idle point)
IDLE_GM   = -0.035

# - Max. allowed idle current during the test (this is usually more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
IIDLE     = 0.1
