[PSU1]

# DUT is connected with normal polarity (not inverted):
POLARITY = 1

# Test voltage V1 starts at 0 V:
VSTART = 0

# Test voltage V1 ends at 60 V:
### VEND   = 60
VEND   = 20

# Test voltage V1 steps are 0.5 V:
### VSTEP  = 0.5
VSTEP  = 1

# Max. allowed current during the test is 15 A:
IMAX   = 15

# Max. allowed power during the test is 100 W:
PMAX   = 100

# Idle conditions for pre-heat and idle between readings are configured to fixed values (PSU2 output will be regulated to attain these values, see below):

# - Idle voltage is 25 V (will be set as voltage limit at PSU-1 during idling):
VIDLE  = 25

#   (no min. or max. idle voltage is specified, which tells the program to use a fixed V1 idle voltage)

# - Idle current is 3 A, which is the target value to be attained with PSU-2 regulation
#   (make sure this is lower and not too close to IMAX):

# Max. allowed current during the test is 1 A (this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):

# Max. allowed power during the test is 5 W (again, this is way more than necessary):

# Idle conditions configured such that PSU-2 regulates the idle conditions configured for PSU-1

# - V2 start value is set to 3.0 V:

IDLE_GM   = 20

# - Max. allowed idle current during the test is 1 A (this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
