How To: Reconfigure the Silabs CP2102 USB/UART interface of the Voltcraft PPS power supplies to allow accessing more than one PSU via /dev/serial/by-id/xyz

* Download cp210x-cfg code:
svn co https://github.com/DiUS/cp210x-cfg.git

* Install USB library stuff needed to compile the cp210x-cfg program:
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev 

* Compile the cp210x-cfg program:
cd path/to/cp210x-cfg/
make

* Display HELP information for cp210x-cfg:
./cp210x-cfg -h
Syntax:
cp210x-cfg [-h ] |
           [-m vid:pid] [-d bus:dev]
           [ -l | [-V vid] [-P pid] [-F flush] [-M mode] [-N name] [-S serial]]

  -h            This help
  -m vid:pid    Find and use first device with vid:pid
  -d bus:dev    Find and use device at bus:dev
  -l            List all CP210x devices connected
  -V vid        Program the given Vendor ID
  -P pid        Program the given Product ID
  -F flush      Program the given buffer flush bitmap (CP2105 only)
  -M mode       Program the given SCI/ECI mode (CP2105 only)
  -N name       Program the given product name string
  -S serial     Program the given serial string

Unless the -d option is used, the first found CP210x device is used.
If no programming options are used, the current values are printed.

* List all Silabs CP210x devices connected to the computer:
./cp210x-cfg -l
ID 10c4:ea60 @ bus 002, dev 031: CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller

* Make sure only one Silabs CP210x is connected (the one you want to configure), then show its information:
./cp210x-cfg
ID 10c4:ea60 @ bus 002, dev 031: CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller
Model: CP2102
Vendor ID: 10c4
Product ID: ea60
Name: CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller
Serial: 0001

* Change the Serial ID of the device:
./cp210x-cfg -S 0010

* Unplug and re-plug the device, then show it's (new) information:
./cp210x-cfg
ID 10c4:ea60 @ bus 002, dev 034: CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller
Model: CP2102
Vendor ID: 10c4
Product ID: ea60
Name: CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller
Serial: 0010

Apply the same change to the second Voltcraft PPS (using a different Serial!). The Voltcraft PPS supplies are then accessible as follows:

PSU1: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0010-if00-port0
PSU2: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_0020-if00-port0

DONE!
